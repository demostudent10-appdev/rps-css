# RPS CSS

This project is for you to type along with the Introduction to CSS video. There are no automated test, so `rails grade` won't do anything.

Experiment!

## Standard Workflow

 1. Start the web server with `bin/server`.
 1. Navigate to your live application preview.
 1. As you work, remember to navigate to `/git` and **Always Be Committing.**
